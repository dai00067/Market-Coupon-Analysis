### Background and purpose   
	My client was a hotel corporate with casino. While the head count and coupon redemptions were down, they came to us and sought for solutions. In this case, to drive the number of visits for the hotel, I conducted a marketed coupon analysis to answer 3 questions: who uses coupons, what coupons were redeemed,  and what is being offered.                

### Data          
	6 tables with customer, coupon type and redemption information. So before the analysis, I performed a lot of ETL and feature engineer to get the clean tables I can use.             

### Challenges and methods:             
	Who use coupon: divide guest into coupon-dependent and coupon neglecter by the percentage of days that a guest used a coupon.         
	What coupons were redeemed:             
		Coupon-dependent guests redeem hotel and cash offer more than anything else. Make sure they get them.            
		Also, offer more Slot Gaming coupons to coupon-dependent players since it has a way higher redemption rate.             
		
Within coupon-dependent guests, I used clustering analysis that revealed four distinct customer segments given their age, income, miles away etc. And provided test ways to leverage their love of promotions to drive visits.
